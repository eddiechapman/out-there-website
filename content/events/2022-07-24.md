### ira george

ira george of *Tamper Tamper* is a just another Riverwest punk. Her work is physical and auditory, romantic and mundane. Any process that leaves room for happenstance will do. She loves alleyway garbage and is an aspiring birder.

### Chelsea Tadeyeske

Chelsea Tadeyeske writes poems from the deep empathic ditch beside the expressway of American dismissal & makes chapbooks under the moniker *pitymilk press*. She wants to go swimming in many people. See her run at [chelseatadeyeske.wordpress.com](chelseatadeyeske.wordpress.com) or follow her on Instagram at [@pity_milk](https://www.instagram.com/pity_milk/).

### Mere of Light

Half haunted half hopeful, Mere of Light draws material from sound archives, field recordings, fairytales, and folk ballads, using song as a medium to explore temporal cycles.
