### Social Caterpillar

Self-described as a psychedelic chamber ensemble for the disobedient and melancholic youth, Milwaukee’s Social Caterpillar have been playing and recording a unique style of music that defies simple categorization together since 2016. Their sound combines deeply personal lyrics with an ethic towards protest layered over acoustic and distorted guitars and a pounding rhythm section mixed with sprawling string and horn arrangements.

### Apollo Vermouth

Apollo Vermouth was born from the somber remains of cloudy memories, personal psychedelics, and suburban decay - operating as a distant siren out of Milwaukee’s experimental underbelly. Her transmissions point skyward as allusive sonic memoirs, slowly floating back to the earth as testaments of a much larger context: hope, honesty, and love for those trapped in a cold, unforgiving world.

### Sarah Clausen

Sarah Clausen is a saxophonist, composer and educator based in Chicago, IL. Utilizing space, unique melodic content, and diverse textures, Sarah has developed an approach to improvisation and composition that is forward moving, and inspired by many musical traditions.
