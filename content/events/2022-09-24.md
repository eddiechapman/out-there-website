### Gauss

As difficult to describe as they are easy to enjoy, Gauss perfectly straddles the line between listenability and challenge. Melody-driven yet complex, subtle, and sly, Gauss defies categorization with “life-affirming intensity”.

### Julia Blair

Julia Blair was born of this world as a force to smother the disquieting agents of despair- and as a gentle soul that no- less employs her mighty voice to speak truth to power. Those who know her personally know this, and those who have heard her sing know this as well. On her debut solo album for Crutch of Memory Enterprises, **Better Out Than In**, Julia proclaims her fondness for self-expression and demonstrates her aptitude for dynamics: from the explosive nature of a pop hook to the firm, comforting grip of a lullaby. She does so at- times anecdotally, while utilizing the marriage of sophisticated arrangements and plain-spoken lyrical language.

### Little Trouble Girl

little trouble girl is the semi-improvised art noise project of Joe Clark (vocals/lyrics) Alec Dolter (drums/keys) and Grace Mitchell (keys/drums). The performance mixes ambient experimental instrumentals and stream of consciousness vocals from the perspective of a 6 year old girl.
