### Charles Edward Payne 

Charles Payne won Arts + Literature Laboratory’s inaugural ALL Originals Prize for his poems **“Dead End”** and **“Dinner with a Pig.”** This was his first national publication. Charles Payne is a Madison transplant, a certified teacher, and a self-taught social artist from Michigan. As a child, he loved hearing the sound of Paul Harvey’s voice, their innate ability to describe every intricate detail truly inspired Charles to tell stories himself. And, yes, Charles can’t wait to give you the rest of the story.

### Caley Conway

Rooted in folk but hardly bound to it, Caley Conway’s inventive style ranges from jazz to post-rock, hints at the familiar, and embraces a dissonant beauty. The Milwaukeean’s breezy voice and disarming wit belie a deep complexity, bringing a new set of rules to the singer-songwriter paradigm.
