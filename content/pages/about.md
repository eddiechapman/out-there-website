Title: About

Out There Series is an ongoing opportunity for Midwest poets and experimental musicians to share their unique experiences of sound in distinct locations notable for their local history. The series is meant to reflect interconnections between environmental and artistic ecosystems, creating a meditative atmosphere where the sound of birdcall is as vital as guitar. An Out There gathering is a chance to foster deep listening, nurturing appreciation for the sounds that nature provides and supporting them with mellow musicality and poetry.
